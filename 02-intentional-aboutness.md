## Brief

1. Write a concise single sentence about yourself as a designer, in under 120 characters in length (aim for around 100, if possible).
    - For example: Experience designer. I like to rethink things through experimentation, compassion, and a sense of humor. (104 characters)
2. Write a separate short paragraph about who you are, beyond being a designer with a sense of humor; a personal bio, with an emphasis on keywords and under 300 characters in length.
    - For example: I grew up in the ‘burbs of New York, make a lot of self deprecating jokes, and I’m notorious for being average at a thousand hobbies—most recently <s>guitar</s> piano, <s>mini</s> Monday crossword puzzles, <s>embroidery</s> knitting, and hand lettering.
3. Choose a project to develop as a case study for your portfolio and write about the process using the PAR and RAD content methods. Aim for around 500 *words* (not characters).
    - See [Case Studies](#case-studies) for examples.

## Warm-up

Consider generating a keyword list to start the process of writing:

- designer
- rethink
- experimentation
- compassion
- humor

## Methods

### PAR

Problem, action, and result:

1. What problem did the project solve?
2. What actions did you take to do this project?
3. How successful were you in solving the problem?
    - What were the results of the project?

### RAD

Lean content is reliable, authentic, and direct language (this builds the reader’s trust and confidence).

1. Reliable
    - It sets and meets the reader’s expectations; it’s consistent throughout each piece of content.
2. Authentic
    - If feels like a real conversation is happening; the language is natural and clear.
3. Direct
    - It gives you exactly what you need to make a decision.
