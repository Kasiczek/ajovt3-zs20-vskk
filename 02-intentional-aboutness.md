## Brief

1. Write a concise single sentence about yourself as a designer, in under 120 characters in length (aim for around 100, if possible).
    - For example: Experience designer. I like to rethink things through experimentation, compassion, and a sense of humor. (104 characters)
2. Write a separate short paragraph about who you are, beyond being a designer with a sense of humor; a personal bio, with an emphasis on keywords and under 300 characters in length.
    - For example: I grew up in the ‘burbs of New York, make a lot of self deprecating jokes, and I’m notorious for being average at a thousand hobbies—most recently <s>guitar</s> piano, <s>mini</s> Monday crossword puzzles, <s>embroidery</s> knitting, and hand lettering.
3. Choose a project to develop as a case study for your portfolio and write about the process using the PAR and RAD content methods. Aim for around 300–500 *words* (not characters).
    - See [Case Studies](#case-studies) for examples.

## Warm-up

Consider generating a keyword list to start the process of writing:

- designer
- rethink
- experimentation
- compassion
- humor

## Methods

### PAR

Problem, action, and result:

1. What problem did the project solve?
2. What actions did you take to do this project?
3. How successful were you in solving the problem?
    - What were the results of the project?

### RAD

Lean content is reliable, authentic, and direct language (this builds the reader’s trust and confidence).

1. Reliable
    - It sets and meets the reader’s expectations; it’s consistent throughout each piece of content.
2. Authentic
    - If feels like a real conversation is happening; the language is natural and clear.
3. Direct
    - It gives you exactly what you need to make a decision.

## Handoff

Share your repo URL in the `02-intentional-aboutness` project channel of your Slack workspace.

**Optional:** Share via email or Slack for feedback before posting to the project channel.

### GitHub Config

- Create a project folder (repo) with two Markdown files, plus an `img` folder with images.
  - For example:
    - `02-intentional-aboutness`
      - `about.md`
      - `case-study.md`
      - `img`
        - `filename.png`
        - `…`

### Markdown Files

- `about.md`

```
## Your Name

A concise single sentence about yourself as a designer (aim for about 100 characers).

A separate short paragraph about who you are, beyond being a designer with a sense of humor; a personal bio, with an emphasis on keywords and under 300 characters in length.
```

- `case-study.md`

```
# Project Title

Content goes here…

![Alt text description.](img/filename.png)

Note: Use Markdown for headings, paragraphs, lists, quotes, images, etc., to add structural meaning to your content.
```

### Image Details

See [Images](#images) for resources on choosing the right image format and file optimization.

- Size: Export images to a max width of `1280 px` (considered full-width-esque) at a resolution of `72 px` and any width below depending on your content.
- Format: If it’s a photo, save as a JPG; and if it’s *not* a photo, save as a PNG.
- Name: Use a meaningful filename, in all-lowercase, and separate words with hyphens. See [Naming guidelines](https://developers.google.com/style/filenames) and <cite>[Dashes vs. underscores](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/dashes-vs-underscores/)</cite> for details.
  - Use the filename convention of case, letter, first name initial followed by last name (surname) combined with the best practice of all-lowercase and separate words with hyphens.
    - For example: `project-detail-1.png`

**Note:**

For those with animation, without sound, use an animated GIF as the file format and still use Markdown’s image syntax (`![Alt text description.](img/animation.gif)`).

And those with a video, with sound, you'll want add the HTML `video` element to your Markdown file.

For example:

```html
<video controls src="video/filename.mp4" poster="img/video-poster.png" width="1280">
```
