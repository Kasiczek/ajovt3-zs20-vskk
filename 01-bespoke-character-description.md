**Alt text description:** `A large painted black serif capital letter O with a white oval center on an off-white background.`

> Alternative text should be succinct, yet descriptive of the content and function of an image. Lengthy alternative text (more than around 100 characters) often indicates that extraneous content or content that is not available to sighted users is being presented.

## Brief

1. Design a bespoke character; working from the Latin alphabet, choose a single letterform from A through Z using any style (lowercase or uppercase, sans-serif or serif, cursive or fantasy, etc.) and technique (analog or digital).
2. Write a concise, accessible, and semantic alternative text description of the final letterform design in under 100 characters.
    - For example: A large painted black serif capital letter O with a white oval center on an off-white background.
3. Also consider text for a caption: Letter, designer, and a list of materials or process.
    - For example: *O*, Lauren Cook. Assorted moss for floral arrangements, hot glue, and wire.

### Details

#### Artwork

Capture and save final artwork in a digital format using these guidlines:

- Size: Use a square with a width and height of `1080 px` × `1080 px` (think Instagram artwork size).
- Format: If it’s a photo, save as a JPG; and if it’s *not* a photo, save as a PNG.
- Name: Use a meaningful filename and in lowercase.
  - For example: `capital-letter-o.jpg`
