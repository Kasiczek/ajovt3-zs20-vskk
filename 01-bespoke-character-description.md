# Bespoke Character & Description

**Alt text description:** `A large painted black serif capital letter O with a white oval center, on an off-white background.`

> Alternative text should be succinct, yet descriptive of the content and function of an image. Lengthy alternative text (more than around 100 characters) often indicates that extraneous content or content that is not available to sighted users is being presented.

## Brief

1. Design a bespoke character; working from the modern English alphabet, choose a single letterform from A to Z (one of 26 letters) using any style (lowercase or uppercase, sans-serif or serif, cursive or fantasy, etc.) and technique (analog or digital).
2. Write a concise, accessible, and semantic alternative text description of the final letterform design in under 100 characters.
    - For example: A large painted black serif capital letter O with a white oval center, on an off-white background.
3. Also consider text for a caption: Letter, designer, and a list of materials or process.
    - For example: *O*, Lauren Cook. Assorted moss for floral arrangements, hot glue, and wire.

### Details

#### Artwork

Capture and save your final artwork in a digital format using these guidelines:

- Size: Use a square with a width and height of `1080 px` × `1080 px` (think Instagram artwork size).
- Format: If it’s a photo, save as a JPG; and if it’s *not* a photo, save as a PNG.
- Name: Use a meaningful filename, in all-lowercase, and separate words with hyphens. See [Naming guidelines](https://developers.google.com/style/filenames) and <cite>[Dashes vs. underscores](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/dashes-vs-underscores/)</cite> for details.
  - For example: `capital-letter-o.jpg`

#### Text

- Write your description in sentence case; start with a capital letter and end with a period.
- Keep your description short; aim for 100 characters or less, unless there is a lot to describe (120 is a good limit).

**Note:**

- Capitalize abbreviations and acronyms, but remove ampersands.
  - For example: The acronym (and brand) “C&A” becomes “C and A”.

### Handoff

## Vocabulary

- **Alt text**
  - Short for *alternative* text. Alternative text provides a descriptive textual alternative to non-text content such as images and charts in web pages and digital publishing formats.
- **Accessible**
  - Easily understood; approachable. Accessible content that’s friendly and usable by as many people as possible.
- **Bespoke**
  - Handmade; made by hand. Bespoke type can make a first impression count, and is often one of the first things people notice about a brand.
- **Semantic**
  - Meaningful; relating to the meaning of a word, phrase, sentence, or text. Semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to web page content rather than just visual presentation.
