## Brief

> Design is storytelling.
>
> — [Ellen Lupton](https://ellenlupton.com), designer (writer, curator, and educator)

Everything is a remix. Remix the content from the semester into a short presentation. You may show work from this course, other courses (past or current), an internship, or maybe the work of another or others that have inspired you, etc.

If you’re a minimalist designer — show us, tell us. If you’re passionate about details — show us, tell us. And if you’re in love with typography, color, etc. — tell us a story through your design work. What would you present at a [Creative Mornings](https://creativemornings.com/talks/mike-monteiro--2/1) talk (but shorter)?

## Presentation

You decide the flow. Keep it short, smart, and simple, but tell a story. It could be a case study, or your story as a designer, or what you love about design. You decide the story. You tell the story. You design the story.

- Content first, with text and images in Markdown (and a link to the PDF version).
- Design second, with the same text and images, as a PDF.

### Format

≈ 20 minutes overall via Zoom on December 15 or 22.

- Final presentation (5–10 minutes)
- Walkthrough of all course assignments and *optional* extra credit (≈ 5 minutes)
- Feedback (≈ 5 minutes)

**Note:** You must attend both final classes to support your colleagues.

### GitHub Config
- Create a project folder (repo) with a Markdown file and a PDF file, plus an `img` folder with images.
  - For example:
    - `05-presentation-stoytelling`
      - `presentation-2020-jgagne.md`
      - `presentation-2020-jgagne.pdf`
      - `img`
        - `…`
        - `…`
        - `…`

### Markdown Files

- `presentation-2020-jgagne.md`
