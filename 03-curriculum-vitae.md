# Curriculum Vitae

> As a law student, I went on a few job interviews. At one, the interviewer’s first comment was “It’s so unusual that I see a résumé without any typos.”

## Brief

Write and design a curriculum vitae, résumé, in Markdown for content first, and as a downloadable PDF for design second.

1. Use Markdown to focus on content first only, while providing a link to a PDF version.
2. Use a PDF to focus on the look and feel with typography, color, and layout — design second.

## Handoff

Share your repo URL in the `03-curriculum-vitae` project channel of your Slack workspace.

**Optional:** Share via email or Slack for feedback before posting to the project channel.

### GitHub Config

- Create a project folder (repo) with a Markdown file and a PDF file, with an *optional* `img` folder for a headshot image and/or a `pdf` folder for the PDF, if you want to be overly organized.
  - For example:
    - `03-curriculum-vitae`
      - `cv-2020-jgagne.md`
      - `cv-2020-jgagne.pdf`

**Note:**

It’s useful to add the year, YYYY, to the filename to keep yourself current.

Also as a reminder, use of a first name initial followed by last name (surname) combined with the best practice of all-lowercase and separate words with hyphens helps to keep the filename short, accessible, and readable.

### Markdown Files

- `cv-2020-jgagne.md`

```

Use Markdown for headings, paragraphs, lists, quotes, images, etc., to add structural meaning to your content.
